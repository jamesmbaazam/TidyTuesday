# TidyTuesday
A repository to contain my tidy Tuesday submissions on twitter. This will also be a repository to showcase my visualizations.

## How to run the code
1. Start by opening the .rprog file to start a new session and establish a root directory
2. Open a script and source it. Hopefully, it should run without errors.

## Dependencies
1. the tidyverse packages for data wrangling and visualizations.
2. Themes from `ggthemes`.
3. Grid arrangement with `patchwork`, `gridExtra`.
4. Publication-ready plots with `ggpubr`.

Install the dependencies with `install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'ggthemes', 'patchwork', 'griExtra', 'ggpubr'))`
