title: "Spotify Audio Features + Music Genres"
output: github_document

Musical genre is far from black and white - there are no hard and fast rules for classifying a given track or artist as "hard rock" vs. "folk rock," but rather the listener knows it when they hear it. Is it possible to classify songs into broad genres? And what can quantitative audio features tell us about the qualities of each genre?  

## Exploring Spotify's audio features  

The [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) provides artist, album, and track data, as well as audio features and analysis, all easily accessible via the R package [`spotifyr`](https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr).    

There are 12 [audio features](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/object-model/#audio-features-object) for each track, including confidence measures like `acousticness`, `liveness`, `speechiness` and `instrumentalness`, perceptual measures like `energy`, `loudness`, `danceability` and `valence` (positiveness), and descriptors like `duration`, `tempo`, `key`, and `mode`.

It's likely that Spotify uses these features to power products like Spotify Radio and custom playlists like Discover Weekly and Daily Mixes. Those products also make use of Spotify's vast listener data, like listening history and playlist curation, for you and users similar to you. Spotify has the benefit of letting humans create relationships between songs and weigh in on genre via listening and creating playlists. With just the quantitative features, is it possible to classify songs into broad genres? And what can these audio features tell us about the qualities of each genre?   
  
We'll look into a sample of songs from six broad genres - `pop`, `rap`, `rock`, `latin`, `EDM`, and `R&B` - to find out.  

### TL;DR:  

Decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost models were trained on the audio feature data for 33,000+ songs. The random forest model was able to classify ~54% of songs into the correct genre, a marked improvement from random chance (1 in 6 or ~17%), while the individual decision tree shed light on which audio features were most relevant for classifying each genre:  

`Rap`: speechy.  
`Rock`: can't dance to it.  
`EDM`: high tempo.  
`R&B`: long songs.  
`Latin`: very danceable.  
`Pop`: everything else.  

`Rap` was one of the easier genres to classify, largely thanks to the speechiness feature. Low danceability helped separate out `rock` tracks, and high `tempo` provided the distinction needed to find `EDM` songs. `R&B`, `pop`, and `latin` songs were most difficult to sort out, but `R&B` songs tended to be longer in duration, and `latin` songs were slightly more danceable than `pop` tracks.

### Getting the data 

Genres were selected from [Every Noise](http://everynoise.com/everynoise1d.cgi?scope=all), a fascinating visualization of the Spotify genre-space maintained by a genre taxonomist. The top four sub-genres for each were used to query Spotify for 20 playlists each, resulting in about 5000 songs for each genre, split across a varied sub-genre space.  


```{r setup, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(formattable)
library(randomForest)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(xgboost)
source('../kp_themes/theme_kp.R')
theme_set(theme_classic() + theme_kp())
options(scipen = 999)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, 
                      warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE)

# refer to spotify_dataset.R for how this dataset was generated
playlist_songs <- read.csv('genre_songs_expanded.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE) 

feature_names <- names(playlist_songs)[12:23]

glimpse(playlist_songs,width = 60)

playlist_songs %>% 
  count(playlist_genre) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

### Exploring audio features by genre  

```{r inspect, fig.height = 12, fig.width = 12}
playlist_songs %>%
  select(c('playlist_genre', feature_names)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = feature_names) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  geom_density(aes(color = playlist_genre), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~name, ncol = 3, scales = 'free') +
  labs(title = 'Spotify Audio Feature Density - by Genre',
       x = '', y = 'density') +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) + 
  scale_color_kp(palette = 'mixed')
```

Overall, the songs in the dataset tend to have low acousticness, liveness, instrumentalness and speechiness, with higher danceability, energy, and loudness. Valence varies across genres.  

Breaking things out by genre, `EDM` tracks are least likely to be acoustic and most likely to have high energy with low valence (sad or depressed); `latin` tracks have high valence (are positive or cheerful) and danceability; `rap` songs score highly for speechiness and danceability; and `rock` songs are most likely to be recorded live and have low danceability. `Pop`, `latin` and `EDM` songs are more likely to have shorter durations compared to `R&B`, `rap`, and `rock.`     

Based on the density plot, it looks like energy, valence, tempo and danceability may provide the most separation between genres during classification, while instrumentalness and key and key may not help much.  

#### Removing outliers   

There are clearly some outliers in duration that may skew analysis. Using the `boxplot` function, we can isolate any values that fall outside of a given range. The default range is the interquartile range, or the spread from the 25th to 50th percentile. Because a lot of values fall outside of that range, we can widen it by incrementing the `range` parameter. Here we've used `range = 4`, which multiplies the interquartile range by 4 to widen the spread of values we'll consider _not_ be outliers.  

```{r outliers, fig.height = 6}
with_outliers <- playlist_songs %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = duration_ms)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = kp_cols('red'), coef = 4) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = 'Duration') 

duration_outliers <- boxplot(playlist_songs$duration_ms, 
                             plot = FALSE, range = 4)$out

playlist_songs_no_outliers <- playlist_songs %>%
  filter(!duration_ms %in% duration_outliers) 

without_outliers <- playlist_songs_no_outliers %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = duration_ms)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = kp_cols('red'), coef = 4) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = 'Duration, outliers removed') 

gridExtra::grid.arrange(with_outliers, without_outliers, ncol = 1)
```

There were `r length(duration_outliers)` songs that were defined as outliers and removed from the dataset, resulting in a distribution maxing out at 516,000 ms (8.6 minutes) instead of 5,100,000 ms (85 minutes).   

#### Correlation between features  

How do these features correlate with one another? Are there any that may be redundant?  

```{r explore_features, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8}
playlist_songs_no_outliers %>%
  select(feature_names) %>%
  scale() %>%
  cor() %>%
  corrplot::corrplot(method = 'color', 
                     order = 'hclust', 
                     type = 'upper', 
                     diag = FALSE, 
                     tl.col = 'black',
                     addCoef.col = "grey30",
                     number.cex = 0.6,
                     col = colorRampPalette(colors = c(
                       kp_cols('red'), 
                       'white', 
                       kp_cols('dark_blue')))(200),
                     main = 'Audio Feature Correlation',
                     mar = c(2,2,2,2),
                     family = 'Avenir')
```

Across all songs and genres in the dataset, energy and loudness are fairly highly correlated (0.68). Let's remove loudness, since energy appears to give more distinction between genre groups (as seen in the density plot).  

Energy and acousticness are negatively correlated, which makes sense, along with the positive correlation between danceability and valence (happier songs lead to more dancing). Liveness, tempo, and energy are clustered together, as are speechiness and danceability. Interestingly, danceability is negatively correlated with tempo and energy. 

```{r}
# remove loudness
feature_names_reduced <- names(playlist_songs)[c(12:14,16:23)]
```

#### Correlation within genres    

How do the genres correlate with each other? We'll calculate the median feature values for each genre and then compute the correlation between those to find out. This doesn't take individual song variation into account, but will give us an idea which genres are similar to each other.  

```{r genre_cor_feature}
# average features by genre
avg_genre_matrix <- playlist_songs_no_outliers %>%
  group_by(playlist_genre) %>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric, median, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup() 

avg_genre_cor <- avg_genre_matrix %>%
  select(feature_names_reduced, -mode) %>% 
  scale() %>%
  t() %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  cor() 

colnames(avg_genre_cor) <- avg_genre_matrix$playlist_genre
row.names(avg_genre_cor) <- avg_genre_matrix$playlist_genre

avg_genre_cor %>% corrplot::corrplot(method = 'color', 
                     order = 'hclust',
                     type = 'upper',
                     tl.col = 'black',
                     diag = FALSE,
                     addCoef.col = "grey40",
                     number.cex = 0.75,
                     col = colorRampPalette(colors = c(
                       kp_cols('red'), 
                       'white', 
                       kp_cols('dark_blue')))(200),
                     mar = c(2,2,2,2),
                     main = 'Correlation Between Median Genre Feature Values',
                     family = 'Avenir')
```

`Rock` and `EDM` is negatively correlated with all genres except for each other, which may make them easy to tell apart from the rest of the genres, but not each other. `Latin` and `R&B` are the most similar, with a positive correlation of 0.57, while `EDM` and `R&B` and `EDM` and `latin` are the most different (-0.83, -0.69). 


## Classifying songs into genres using audio features  

Our first question was _is it possible_ to classify songs into genres with just audio features; our secondary question is _what can these audio features tell us_ about the distinctions between genre. With that aim, we should focus on classification models that are interpretable and provide insight into which features were important in organizing a new song into a given genre.  

Classification algorithms that allow for greater interpretation of the features include `decision trees`, `random forests`, and `gradient boosting`.  

### Preparing the data for training  

First, we'll scale the numeric features, and then split into a training set (80% of the songs) and a test set (20%).  

```{r split}
playlist_songs_scaled <- playlist_songs_no_outliers %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, scale)

set.seed(1234)
training_songs <- sample(1:nrow(playlist_songs_scaled), nrow(playlist_songs_scaled)*.80, replace = FALSE)
train_set <- playlist_songs_scaled[training_songs, c('playlist_genre', feature_names_reduced)] 
test_set <- playlist_songs_scaled[-training_songs, c('playlist_genre', feature_names_reduced)] 

train_resp <- playlist_songs_scaled[training_songs, 'playlist_genre']
test_resp <- playlist_songs_scaled[-training_songs, 'playlist_genre']
```

### Modeling  

#### Decision tree    

[Decision trees](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-guide-to-machine-learning-in-r-for-beginners-decision-trees-c24dfd490abb) are a simple classification tool that have an output that reads like a flow chart, where each node represents a feature, each branch an outcome of a decision on that feature, and the leaves represent the class of the final decision. The algorithm works by partitioning the data into sub-spaces repeatedly in order to create the most homogeneous groups possible. The rules generated by the algorithm are visualized in the tree.  

The biggest benefit of decision trees is in interpretability - the resulting tree provides a lot of information about feature importance. They are also non-parametric and make no assumptions about the data. On the flip side, they are prone to overfitting and may produce high variance between models created from different samples of the same data.  

```{r dt}
set.seed(1111)
model_dt <- rpart(playlist_genre ~ ., data = train_set)

rpart.plot(model_dt, 
           type = 5, 
           extra = 104,
           box.palette = list(purple = "#490B32",
               red = "#9A031E",
               orange = '#FB8B24',
               dark_blue = "#0F4C5C",
               blue = "#5DA9E9",
               grey = '#66717E'),
           leaf.round = 0,
           fallen.leaves = FALSE, 
           branch = 0.3, 
           under = TRUE,
           under.col = 'grey40',
           family = 'Avenir',
           main = 'Genre Decision Tree',
           tweak = 1.2)
```

The most important feature in the decision tree model is speechiness, separating `rap` from the rest of the classes on the first decision. Next, tracks with low danceability are classified as `rock`; then, high-tempo tracks are labelled as `EDM`; next, longer songs are considered `R&B`, and then finally, songs with high danceability are grouped into the `latin` genre, and everything else is considered `pop.`  

The values under the leaves represent the distribution of true values for each class grouped into that leaf; for example, in the `rap` predicted class, 12% were `EDM`, 16% were `latin`, 8% were `pop`, 20% were `R&B`, 40% matched the true value, `rap`, and 3% were `rock` tracks. The value beneath that indicates the percentage of observations classified into that leaf, so 25% of all tracks were classified as `rap` in this tree.  

The decision tree classifier was best at classifying `rock` (43% correct) and `rap` (40% correct) and had the most trouble getting it right for `pop` tracks (30% correct) in the training data. How does it perform on the hold-out test data? 

```{r dt_2}
predict_dt <- predict(object = model_dt, newdata = test_set)
max_id <- apply(predict_dt, 1, which.max)
pred <- levels(as.factor(test_set$playlist_genre))[max_id]

compare_dt <- data.frame(true_value = test_set$playlist_genre,
                         predicted_value = pred,
                         model = 'decision_tree',
                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

model_accuracy_calc <- function(df, model_name) {
  df %>% 
    mutate(match = ifelse(true_value == predicted_value, TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
    count(match) %>% 
    mutate(accuracy = n/sum(n),
           model = model_name)
}

accuracy_dt <- model_accuracy_calc(df = compare_dt, model_name = 'decision_tree')
```

The decision tree model shows an overall accuracy, or percentage of songs classified into their correct genre, of `r percent(accuracy_dt$accuracy[accuracy_dt$match == TRUE],1)`. 

#### Random forest  

[Random forests](https://towardsdatascience.com/random-forest-in-r-f66adf80ec9) are an ensemble of decision trees, aggregating classifications made by multiple decision trees of different depths. This is also known as bootstrap aggregating (or bagging), and helps avoid overfitting and improves prediction accuracy. 

We'll run a random forest model with 100 trees to start, and then take a look at the variable importance.  

```{r random_forest, fig.height = 5}
model_rf <- randomForest(as.factor(playlist_genre) ~ ., ntree = 100, importance = TRUE, data = train_set)

predict_rf <- predict(model_rf, test_set)

compare_rf <- data.frame(true_value = test_resp,
                         predicted_value = predict_rf,
                         model = 'random_forest',
                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE) 

accuracy_rf <- model_accuracy_calc(df = compare_rf, model_name = 'random_forest')
```

The random forest model shows an overall accuracy of `r percent(accuracy_rf$accuracy[accuracy_rf$match == TRUE],1)`. 


#### Gradient boosting with XGBoost  

The next round of improvements to the random forest model come from boosting, or building models sequentially, minimizing errors and boosting the influence of the most successful models. Adding in the gradient descent algorithm for minimizing errors results in a gradient boosting model. Here, we'll use [XGBoost](https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-vishalmorde-xgboost-algorithm-long-she-may-rein-edd9f99be63d), which provides parallel processing to decrease compute time as well as various other improvements.  

We'll use the `xgboost` function with most of the default hyperparameter settings, just setting `objective` to handle multiclass classification.  

```{r gradientboost, fig.height = 5}
matrix_train_gb <- xgb.DMatrix(data = as.matrix(train_set[,-1]), label = as.integer(as.factor(train_set[,1])))
matrix_test_gb <- xgb.DMatrix(data = as.matrix(test_set[,-1]), label = as.integer(as.factor(test_set[,1])))

model_gb <- xgboost(data = matrix_train_gb, 
                    nrounds = 100,
                    verbose = FALSE,
                    params = list(objective = "multi:softmax",
                                  num_class = 6 + 1))

predict_gb <- predict(model_gb, matrix_test_gb)
predict_gb <- levels(as.factor(test_set$playlist_genre))[predict_gb]

compare_gb <- data.frame(true_value = test_resp,
                         predicted_value = predict_gb,
                         model = 'xgboost',
                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE) 

accuracy_gb <- model_accuracy_calc(df = compare_gb, model_name = 'xgboost')
```

The gradient boosting model shows an overall accuracy of `r percent(accuracy_gb$accuracy[accuracy_gb$match == TRUE],1)`. 

### Model comparison  

#### Variable importance  

```{r variable_importance, fig.width = 10}
importance_dt <- data.frame(importance = model_dt$variable.importance)
importance_dt$feature <- row.names(importance_dt)

importance_rf <- data.frame(importance = importance(model_rf, type = 2))
importance_rf$feature <- row.names(importance_rf)

importance_gb <- xgb.importance(model = model_gb)

compare_importance <- importance_gb %>%
  select(Feature, Gain) %>%
  left_join(importance_dt, by = c('Feature' = 'feature')) %>%
  left_join(importance_rf, by = c('Feature' = 'feature')) %>%
  rename('xgboost' = 'Gain',
         'decision_tree' = 'importance',
         'random_forest' = 'MeanDecreaseGini') 

compare_importance %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, scale, center = TRUE) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c('xgboost', 'decision_tree', 'random_forest')) %>%
  rename('model' = 'name') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Feature, value, mean, na.rm = TRUE), y = value, color = model)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = 'Variable Importance by Model',
       subtitle = 'Scaled for comparison',
       y = 'Scaled value', x = '') +
  scale_color_kp(palette = 'cool')
```

Each model uses a different measure for explaining variable importance. Decision trees provide a score for each feature based on its usefulness in splitting the data. For a random forest, we can use `mean decrease in node impurity`, which is the average decrease in node impurity/increase in node purity resulting from a split on a given feature. For XGBoost, we can use `gain`, or the improvement in accuracy contributed by a given feature. For all features, the top-ranked feature is typically the most common root node in the tree(s) as they tend to create the biggest reduction in impurity.  

The most important variable for the decision tree model was speechiness, while the random forest and XGBoost models found tempo to be the most useful. Danceability, energy, duration, and valence were also found to be important features for separating songs into genres, while mode and key didn't contribute much. 

#### Accuracy  

Accuracy, or percentage of songs classified into their correct genre, ranged from 36% to 54% by model.  

```{r final_comparison, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 5}
accuracy_rf %>%
  rbind(accuracy_dt) %>%
  rbind(accuracy_gb) %>%
  filter(match == TRUE) %>%
  select(model, accuracy) %>%
  mutate(accuracy = percent(accuracy,2)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

If we guessed randomly which genre to assign to each song in this dataset, the accuracy would be 16.6% (or 1 in 6). The decision tree improved on random chance twofold, and random forest and XGBoost improved it more than threefold, though none would be very reliable in practice.    

Classifying fewer genres would likely improve this metric, and trying to classify more than 6 would likely drive it down further. It's unlikely that this approach is a robust way to classify music in real life, where Spotify handles thousands of different genres and subgenres.

How did each model fare for each genre?  

```{r compare_plot, fig.width = 10}
compare_dt %>%
  rbind(compare_rf) %>%
  rbind(compare_gb) %>%
  count(true_value, predicted_value, model) %>%
  mutate(match = ifelse(true_value == predicted_value, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  group_by(true_value, model) %>%
  mutate(pct = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(label = ifelse(match == TRUE, 
                        paste0(round(pct * 100,1),'%'), 
                        "")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = true_value, 
             y = pct, 
             fill = predicted_value, 
             label = label)) +
  geom_col(position = 'dodge') +
  geom_text(position = position_dodge(width = 1), 
            cex = 2.75, 
            hjust = -0.1) +
  facet_wrap( ~ model, ncol = 3) +
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title = 'Genre Accuracy by Model',
       subtitle = 'Accuracy denoted as a percent label',
       y = 'Percent classified') +
  ylim(c(0,.85)) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_kp() 

```

All genres showed gains in accuracy as we moved from simpler to more complex (decision tree --> random forest/XGBoost), though XGBoost didn't provide improvements for most genres. `Pop`, `latin`, and `R&B` remained the most difficult to classify, while `EDM`, `rap` and `rock` reached more than 65% accuracy.  

### Bonus: Principal component analysis of features  

While it is typically used to reduce dimensionality and prep a dataset for training, [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://uc-r.github.io/pca) can also provide insight into the relationship between features and classes. It reduces the number of variables in a dataset by finding combinations of those variables, called principal components, that explain the majority of the variability in the dataset.    

First, we'll find the covariance between the features, and then their eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvalues tell us what percentage of the variability the principal component (PC) explains, and the eigenvector describes how the PC summarizes the features. We don't need to use all the PCs (n-1, so 11 in this case), but generally can simplify by choosing the number of PCs that together explain the majority of the variance (75-90%).  

```{r pca, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
song_cov <- cov(playlist_songs_scaled[,feature_names_reduced])
song_eigen <- eigen(song_cov)

data.frame(proporation_of_variance = song_eigen$values/sum(song_eigen$values)) %>%
  mutate(cumulative_prop = cumsum(proporation_of_variance),
         pc = 1:n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pc, y = cumulative_prop)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  ylim(c(0,1)) +
  labs(title = 'Cumulative Scree Plot', 
       x = 'Principal Component', y = 'Cumulative % of variance explained') 
```

Typically we would look for an "elbow" where the variance explained by subsequent PCs drops off, but there isn't one here. We would need to retain 7 PCs to explain >75% of the variance, which is a great improvement from 12 features, but doesn't help much with understanding the relationship between the features and song genres.  

Let's look a little closer at the first two for simplicity's sake.  

```{r pca_2, fig.height = 5}
song_eigenvectors <- song_eigen$vectors[,1:2] * -1
song_eigenvectors <- song_eigenvectors %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  mutate(feature = row.names(song_cov)) %>%
  rename('PC1' = 'V1',
         'PC2' = 'V2')

song_eigenvectors %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c('PC1', 'PC2')) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = feature, y = value)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = feature), position = 'dodge') +
  facet_wrap(~name, ncol = 2) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = 'Principal Component Loadings', 
       x = 'loading', y = '') +
  scale_fill_kp() 
```

The first PC is characterized by high acoustincess and low tempo and energy; the second by low valence and danceability. Songs with similar scores will map onto these components. 

How does this map onto genres?  

```{r pca_3}
PC <- data.frame(playlist_genre = playlist_songs_scaled$playlist_genre,
                 PC1 = as.matrix(playlist_songs_scaled[,feature_names_reduced]) %*% song_eigenvectors[,1], 
                 PC2 = as.matrix(playlist_songs_scaled[,feature_names_reduced]) %*% song_eigenvectors[,2])

PC %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = playlist_genre)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) + 
  facet_wrap(~playlist_genre) +
  labs(title = 'Plotting principal components 1 vs 2') +
  scale_color_kp(palette = 'mixed') 

```

It's clear once we plot the first two components against each other why they don't explain all of the variability - the distributions of each genre look fairly similar to each other (i.e. the PCs are not clearly dividing them from each other). `Pop` and `rock` tend to push into the upper right quadrant, mapping slightly more strongly onto PC1 than the other genres, while `EDM` pushes into the top left quadrant, mapping more strongly onto PC2 than other genres, likely due to its characteristically low valence. 

### Conclusion: What did we learn?  

Decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost models were trained on the audio feature data for 33,000+ songs. The random forest model was able to classify ~54% of songs into the correct genre, a marked improvement from random chance (1 in 6 or ~17%), while the individual decision tree shed light on which audio features were most relevant for classifying each genre:  

`Rap`: speechy.  
`Rock`: can't dance to it.  
`EDM`: high tempo.  
`R&B`: long songs.  
`Latin`: very danceable.  
`Pop`: everything else.  

`Rap` was one of the easier genres to classify, largely thanks to the speechiness feature. Low danceability helped separate out `rock` tracks, and high `tempo` provided the distinction needed to find `EDM` songs. `R&B`, `pop`, and `latin` songs were most difficult to sort out, but `R&B` songs tended to be longer in duration, and `latin` songs were slightly more danceable than `pop` tracks.
